# CViewGL
Simple 3D viewer in OpenGL using CMake and C++

Dependencies:
* assimp-3.0.1270
* glew-2.0.0
* glfw-3.2.1
* glm-0.9.7.1
* SOIL

The viewer can do the following right now:
* Load OBJ files with textures.
* Rotate the model with the mouse.
* Zoom with mouse.
* Resizable window and viewport.
* Simple visualization shaders without lighting.

I am still working on it, so new functionality will come. 
It only works on Windows now, but I will support other systems.
